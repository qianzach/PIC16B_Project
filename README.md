# PIC16B_Project
Fall 2021 Capstone Project for PIC 16B (Advanced Data Science with Python) with Renzo Tanaka-Wong

## Abstract
## Planned Deliverables
## Resources Required
Several resources will be required in order to complete our project. First, we will need access to network-linked data. We are currently in the process of finding specific datasets that pique our interest from the following [collection of datasets](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~arb/data/). Secondly, we will require learning materials -  from research papers to online tutorials - in order to learn the ins and outs of network analysis. Through this we hope to learn the mathematical intuition behind network analysis and how it can be directly implemented in Python.
## Tools and Skills Required
## What You Will Learn
## Risks
Potential limitations to our project include our limited understanding of network analysis and limitations to our data. The first obstacle we may face is having a limited understanding of network analysis. Since this topic is a foreign topic to our team, we will have to start by developing an understanding of the math behind network links, graphs, and clustering algorithms before implementing our code. Our understanding will thus determine the depth and scope of our project. Another limitation to our project may be our data. Since we are interested in clustering algorithms, we may find that our data lacks the depth and complexity we desire. Additionally if our data has multiple links, we may be looking at a hypergraph problem which will be out of our scope. Thus carefully sourcing and selecting our data will be essential.
## Ethics
## Tentative Timeline
In the first two weeks of our project we plan to find our data (either by scraping or using an existing dataset) and will complete exploratory data analysis on it. In the following two weeks we will begin to explore clusters and visualization methods for our linked data. Finally, in the last two weeks we will create and implement a custom clustering algorithm and run simulations on our data.
