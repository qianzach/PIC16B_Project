# PIC16B_Project
Fall 2021 Capstone Project for PIC 16B (Advanced Data Science with Python) with Renzo Tanaka-Wong

## Abstract
## Planned Deliverables
## Resources Required
Several resources will be required in order to complete our project. First, we will need access to network-linked data. We are currently in the process of finding specific datasets that pique our interest from the following [collection of datasets](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~arb/data/). Secondly, we will require learning materials -  from research papers to online tutorials - in order to learn the ins and outs of network analysis. Through this we hope to learn the mathematical intuition behind network analysis and how it can be directly implemented in Python.
