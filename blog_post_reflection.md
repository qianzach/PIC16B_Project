# Reflection Blog Post 

**Note: Renzo and Zach did the reflection blog post together.**

## *Overall, what did you achieve in your project?*

We made a recommendation engine based on network analysis using a multitude of Python libraries into the framework of a seamless website. We also achieved a goal in learning how to conduct network analysis and understand networks more than we did at the start of the quarter/project.


## *What are two aspects of your project that you are especially proud of?*

Two things that we're both especially proud of include the functionality/UI of our website, as well as the pretty centrality-based network visualizations we made.

For the website interface, we're proud that the user is able to interact with the website and not stick with a static website. The drop-down menu and slider from the *Dash* callbacks in our website were, in our opinion, quite **nice**.

For our network visualizations, we're proud in how we were able to glean some mathematical insight from the data we had. I also think that, combined with the *Dash* callbacks, we were able to make visualizations that were actually interpretable and useful for the recommendation engine.

## What are **two** things you would suggest doing to further improve your project?*

Two things we would like to improve on are the recommendation algorithm and the user inputs forr our recommendation algorithm.

First, using a propensity score like we discussed would provide better results, as we could use multimodal, data-integrated approaches by including data from other resources and creating a score. Doing this would allow us to find which shows had the smallest Euclidean distance between the score based on the user's inputs and give out better recommendations rather than just a naive network-based system.

Next, we would like to incorporate more user interaction besides just the drop-down menu and slider. Getting information from users, like what genre, year, and a link to the show they wanted to use as its show of reference would make it more custom for the user.


## How does what you achieved compare to what you set out to do in your proposal? (if you didn't complete everything in your proposal, that's fine!)
